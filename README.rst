ElasticSearch Indexer for Plone content

Features
--------

- Indexes full content in ElasticSearch on a field base
- uses serializers of ``plone.restapi`` to get the JSON for indexing
- configuration of ElasticSearch via ``zope.conf`` (buildout)
- flexible drop-in replacement proxy-index for the catalog (optional)
- default profile installs SearchableText drop-in (optional)


Installation
------------

This addon needs ElasticSearch 6.2 with `ingest-attachment plugin <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/6.2/ingest-attachment.html>`_ installed.

Install collective.es.index by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.es.index

also there, configure the connection to ElasticSearch::

    [instance]

    ...

    zope-conf-additional =
         %import collective.es.index
         <elasticsearch>
         query 127.0.0.1:9200
         ingest 127.0.0.1:9200
         </elasticsearch>

and then running ``bin/buildout``.

To install the default drop-in proxy-index for ``SearchableText``,
go to the Site-Setup Add-Ons section and install ``ElasticSearch SearchableText Proxy Index``.

New content will be indexed in ElasticSearch.

To index existing content, a full ``Clear and Rebuild`` is needed (via ZMI/``portal_catalog``/Tab ``Advanced``).
